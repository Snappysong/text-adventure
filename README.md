# text-adventure

This is a text based adventure game that I have been pretty excited to make. I am a big fan of D&D and love any good adventure so I was pretty thrilled when I thought up the idea of making my own. I started to build this with Typescript and React but after watching a short video it seemed like I was making things more complicated that I needed too. I want to expand on this game and make it so you can create a character using state and use that character for multiple stories.
